# Price calculation API

## Project

### Overview
You’re implementing a part of a shopping platform. Design and implement a service that will provide a REST API for calculating a given product's price and amount. Products in the system are identified by UUID. There should be the possibility of applying discounts based on two policies – count based (the more pieces of the product are ordered, the bigger the discount is) and percentage based. Policies should be configurable. Non-functional requirements

- Use Java >= 8 and frameworks of your choice
- The project should be containerized and easy to build and run via Gradle or Maven.
- Please provide a README file with instructions on how to launch it
- There's no need for full test coverage. Implement only the most essential (in your opinion) tests
- Use the git repository for developing the project and after you’re done, send us a link to it
- Make sure we can run the project easily, without any unnecessary local dependencies (e.g., Don’t use OS-specific code)
